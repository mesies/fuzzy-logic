&lt;p>On our company we wanted to create an easy way for someone to run our web application (ASP.NET Core backend + Blazor frontend)
through docker compose for demo/qa purposes, but there was a tiny problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our web application uses an in-house authentication server docker image that
has a lengthy registration process. When someone uses the demo script for the first time or the
database container is deleted when a new version is released, he has to waste several minutes in order to
register our local application with the authentication server.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
