I'm D, a software developer based in the Balkans. My love for programming blogs began during my first year in the field and has only grown since.

I tend to be an easy going person, but when programming is involved, sometimes I let my feelings get the better of me, I can easily be annoyed by the smallest, 
least important things alas the "Grumpy and petty!"
