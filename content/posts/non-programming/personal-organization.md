## Digital Personal Organization

As someone who's lost important photos, forgotten events, and struggled to find notes in the past, I understand the value of personal organization. That's why I'm sharing my personal organization framework.

## The Keys to Effective Digital Personal Organization

The first step to becoming digitally organized is to ensure that everything has one and only one designated place.
The second step is that all digital information should be accessible on every device.

## My Personal Tools for Digital Organization

Here are the platforms and apps I use to stay organized:

## Calendar

### Google Calendar

Google Calendar is my preferred choice for keeping track of events, meetings, birthdays, and deadlines. It's cross-platform, integrates with iOS Calendar, and allows me to easily answer questions about my availability. The digital calendar also allows me to log recurring events, such as air-condition maintenance, so I don't have to keep track of them manually.

## Files and documents

### Google Drive

Google Drive is my go-to for storing files and documents. It's cross-platform, with a convenient Windows application that integrates with Windows Explorer. I used to use Dropbox, but its device number limitation prompted me to switch to Google Drive.

Whenever I receive a document, I scan it, store it in a specific Google Drive folder, and put the original away. This simple process ensures that I never have to search through stacks of paper to find a receipt. Plus, searching through computer files is significantly faster and can be done from anywhere.

## Photos

### Google Photos

After losing all my photos once, I learned the hard way about the importance of backing up. 
I currently use Google Photos for all my photos, as my current collection currently does not require too much space.

## Notes

### Google Keep

Google Keep is my go-to for taking notes, again it is cross platform and it supports tags which helps organizing the notes.

## Password storage

### KeePass + Google Chrome

For password and secret management, I use a combination of KeePass and Google Chrome. Conveniently, Google Chrome is where I store passwords that aren't too sensitive. If any of these passwords get out, it won't be a big deal since I've set up two-factor authentication for the passwords I care.

For more sensitive information, like credit card numbers, e-banking credentials, private keys etc. I use KeePass, with a comically big password. There are apps that can open the KeePass database for both iOS and Android using biometric information like Face ID and fingerprint so you don't have to insert you password each time which can be inconvenient. 

## Conclusion

This digital personal organization framework will not solve all digital organization related problems, but it can save time and frustration if someone doesn't have an existing system in place.
